# Simple React Notes App(using Context and Hooks!)

A simple notes application that demonstrates the power of React Context API and React Hooks, bootstrapped from create-react-app.

## Application Comments

Throughout the application are comments to explain what each component/section of the app does. Most comments include a reference link to more information about the action being performed.

## Scripts

`npm start` - Starts the application on a local dev server.  
`npm run build` - Build a production version of the application in the public folder.  
`npm run test` - Runs the test suite (currently none) using the Jest testing framework.  
`npm run eject` - Extracts all build modules for increased customization.
